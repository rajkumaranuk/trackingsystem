# Read Me First
The tracking system has been implemented using jdk 1.8

The project can be executed by maven

mvn clean package

# Swagger-UI
http://localhost:8080/iot/swagger-ui.html

# Design and Implementation
I have implemented the application using spring-boot, swagger, lombok, mapstruct, apache-commons-csv

I have written some unit tests to the TrackingService class to show that how the tests can be written. As it is taking too much of my time I have stopped writing test for each classes. But you can assume that I would be writing the tests in the same way.

I have written integration test for covering all the possible scenarios and the code coverage is reaching 97% with those tests.
